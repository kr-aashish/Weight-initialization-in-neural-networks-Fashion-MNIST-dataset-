### Weight initialisation for Neural Networks
### Jul 2020 - Jul 2020
- Studied the impact of different weight initialisation strategies on the training time and performance of Neural Networks using Fashion-MNIST dataset.
- Initialised weights as constants, random uniform & in normal distribution and trained the model for 2 epochs to compare the model performance for different weight initialisation strategies.
- Used the general rule for weight initialisation in which weights are initialised are in [-y, y], y = 1/√n, where n is the number of neurons in that layer.
- Finally Implementated the general rule in normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1/√n, to get the most optimised model.
